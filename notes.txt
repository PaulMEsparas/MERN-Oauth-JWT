//add afunctionality
- add a route
- go to controllers to create that function for the route
- go to FE and implement that call or api call.
- create its action creator (action)
- go to reducer and create the new case
- dispatch the action by going to the component you need it done


//adding Like functionality

- add a route (patch request to you routes in your server), make sure to add it to you imports
- go to controllers and create that function as to what happen when going to that route
- go to FE, add the api call
- go to actions of your redux, and create that action which dispatches to the store
- go to your reducers and create that new case
- go to the component to dispatch an action to update the likePost and add the id as its argument

//Adding a space
&nbsp;

//App not responsive yet, material UI used is outdated

//Redux action type constants should be declared separately for optimization and avoid untraceable errors
    Using contants will give you an error if there are any typos

//Deployment for backEnd
        - Used Heroku as example
        -move your node modules away from your github
            -gitignore (node_modules build)
        -Procfile
            - will start when deployed in heroku
            - web: npm run start

        -URL for your backend or api should be the URL assigned by heroku when deployed

//Deploy for FE
        - Used Netlify for this App
        - npm run build and then use that file to deploy in Netlify
        - will run on the backend since the Url was already pointing to the backend in Heroku not localhost
